# Wordle themes in VS Code
Tired of sharing the same green yellow Wordle squares to your group chat? 

Mix it up using this extension and create your own emoji results! 

You can use some of the preset ones, or make your own emoji set. 

In your `settings.json`, you can set an emoji for the correct and incorrect letters. For instance:

```
"wordlethemes.themes": [
    {
        "name": "Chicks",
        "correctSpotEmoji": "üê£",
        "correctLetterEmoji": "üê§",
        "wrongLetterEmoji": "ü•ö"
    }
]
```

Enjoy and wordle away!
